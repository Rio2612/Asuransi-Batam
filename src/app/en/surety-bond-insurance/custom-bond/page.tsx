const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is a Custom Bond and who is involved?",
    a: "A custom bond is a three-party guarantee between the Surety (the insurance company issuing the bond), the Principal (importer/exporter/PPJK), and the Obligee (the Directorate General of Customs and Excise). If the Principal fails to meet its customs obligations, the Surety pays the indemnity to Customs directly — the Principal does not need to deposit cash upfront.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between Custom Bond and OB 23?",
    a: "Custom Bond is the general term for all types of customs guarantees issued by insurance companies. OB 23 (Ordonansi Bea Article 23) is just one specific facility within it, covering temporary imports — goods brought in for a specific purpose (exhibitions, projects, expert equipment) that must be re-exported within a set period.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Custom Bond fully replace a Bank Guarantee?",
    a: "Yes, and that is its main advantage. Indonesia's Customs Law recognizes insurance company guarantees (Custom Bond) as equivalent to Bank Guarantees and cash deposits for customs purposes. Unlike a bank guarantee, Custom Bond generally does not require a 100% cash deposit, keeping company liquidity intact.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long is a Custom Bond valid?",
    a: "Validity follows the duration of the customs facility granted (for example, the temporary import period), plus a buffer for administrative processing. If the facility is extended, the Custom Bond must be extended at the same time to avoid a coverage gap.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents are most often rejected by Customs during application?",
    a: "The most common issues are an unissued Customs facility decree (SKEP), unaudited financial statements for large guarantee values, and an Indemnity Agreement (SPGR) that has not been notarized. Prepare these three documents early to avoid delays.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if a company fails to re-export temporarily imported goods (OB 23)?",
    a: "Customs will collect the import duty and VAT that had been exempted from the Principal. If the Principal does not pay, Customs claims the Custom Bond from the guaranteeing insurance company for the guaranteed value. The Surety then pursues recovery from the Principal under the signed Indemnity Agreement.",

            What Is a Custom Bond?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A <strong>custom bond</strong> (customs bond) is a type of guarantee issued by an
            OJK-licensed general insurance company on behalf of the guaranteed party
            (<em>Principal</em>) — typically an importer, exporter, or customs broker (PPJK) — to
            the Directorate General of Customs and Excise (<em>Obligee</em>). It is governed by
            Law No. 10 of 1995 as amended by Law No. 17 of 2006 on Customs, and Ministry of
            Finance Regulation No. 259/PMK.04/2010 on Customs Guarantees.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#374151] leading-relaxed">
            If the Principal fails to meet its obligations under a granted customs facility — for
            example, failing to re-export temporarily imported goods on time — Customs can claim
            the custom bond directly without first pursuing the Principal. The insurance company
            (<em>Surety</em>) that pays the indemnity then seeks recovery from the Principal under
            the Indemnity Agreement (SPGR) signed at the outset.
          </p>

              An industrial exhibition organizer in Batam imports display equipment worth{" "}
              <strong>IDR 2 billion</strong> from Singapore for a two-week trade show. Since the
              goods will be taken back out of the country, the company applies for the{" "}
              <strong>OB 23 (Temporary Import)</strong> facility to avoid paying full import duty
              upfront. Customs requires a guarantee equal to the potential duty and VAT exempted.
              Instead of depositing cash or tying up a bank credit line, the company issues a
              custom bond for that amount — keeping working capital free for other exhibition needs.

            <p className="text-[#64748b] mt-3 text-xs leading-relaxed">
              Once the goods are re-exported on schedule and proven with an export declaration
              (PEB), the custom bond is closed with no claim ever triggered.
