      {/* ── Intro ── */}
      <p>
        Every company participating in a tender process in Batam — whether for government,
        SOE, or private projects — is generally required to submit a <strong>Bid Bond</strong>{" "}
        (tender guarantee). This document is not just an administrative formality; it is
        proof of your company&apos;s seriousness and ability to fulfill contract obligations
        if selected as the winning bidder.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page explains in full what a bid bond is, who needs one, how much it costs, and
        how to obtain one quickly in Batam.
      </p>

      {/* ── H2: What Is Bid Bond ── */}
      <SectionHeading icon={FileText}>What Is a Bid Bond (Tender Guarantee)?</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        A bid bond is a type of <Link href="/en/surety-bond-insurance">surety bond</Link>{" "}
        issued by an OJK-licensed insurance company. Its function is to guarantee to the
        project owner (<em>obligee</em>) that the bidder (<em>principal</em>) who is declared
        the winner will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sign the work contract in accordance with the submitted bid</li>
        <li>
          Submit a{" "}
          <Link href="/en/surety-bond-insurance/performance-bond">Performance Bond</Link> and{" "}
          <Link href="/en/surety-bond-insurance/advance-payment-bond">Advance Payment Bond</Link>{" "}
          within the specified deadline
        </li>
        <li>Not unilaterally withdraw after the winner is announced</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the winning bidder defaults, the project owner can claim the bid bond to cover the
        cost of re-tendering or any losses incurred.
      </p>

      {/* ── H2: Who Needs Bid Bond ── */}
      <SectionHeading icon={Users}>Who Needs a Bid Bond in Batam?</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        Bid bonds are needed by various types of companies active in procurement of goods and
        services in Batam, including:
      </p>
      <IconList
        items={[
          <><strong>Construction contractors</strong> bidding on building, road, and infrastructure tenders</>,
          <><strong>Manufacturing and industrial companies</strong> in Batam&apos;s industrial estates bidding on machinery and equipment procurement</>,
          <><strong>Procurement companies</strong> acting as vendors for SOEs, BP Batam, or foreign companies</>,
          <><strong>Service companies</strong> such as IT, cleaning services, and security bidding on service tenders</>,
          <><strong>Subcontractors</strong> handling part of a project for the main contractor</>,
        ]}
      />

      {/* ── H2: Guarantee Value ── */}
      <SectionHeading icon={Wallet}>How Much Bid Bond Value Is Required?</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        Under government procurement regulations (Presidential Regulation 16/2018 as amended
        by 12/2021), bid bond values generally range from <strong>1% to 3%</strong> of the
        total bid value (Owner Estimate/HPS). For private projects, the amount is agreed upon
        in each tender&apos;s documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: if a project&apos;s HPS is IDR 10 billion, the required bid bond ranges from
        approximately IDR 100 million to IDR 300 million.
      </p>

      {/* ── H2: Validity Period ── */}
      <SectionHeading icon={CalendarClock}>Bid Bond Validity Period</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        A bid bond is valid throughout the tender period, plus a buffer for the winner
        selection and contract signing process. The typical validity period is{" "}
        <strong>30 to 90 days</strong> from the issuance date, per the tender document
        requirements. If the tender process is extended, the bid bond can be extended
        accordingly.
      </p>

      {/* ── H2: Required Documents ── */}
      <SectionHeading icon={ClipboardList}>Documents Required for a Bid Bond Application</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        Here are the standard documents needed to apply for a bid bond in Batam:
      </p>

      <SectionHeading icon={Scale}>Insurance Bid Bond vs Bank Guarantee: Which Is More Advantageous?</SectionHeading>
      <p>
        Many companies in Batam still use bank guarantees for tender purposes. However, a bid
        bond from an insurance company offers several significant advantages:
      </p>
      <IconList
        items={[
          <><strong>No frozen funds:</strong> A bank guarantee requires you to place a deposit or collateral at the bank. An insurance bid bond does not — your company&apos;s liquidity stays intact.</>,
          <><strong>Lower cost:</strong> Insurance bid bond fees are generally lower than bank guarantee provision fees.</>,
          <><strong>Faster process:</strong> Insurance bid bond issuance can be completed in 1–3 business days, much faster than a bank guarantee process.</>,
          <><strong>Officially recognized:</strong> Bid bonds from OJK-licensed insurers are accepted for government and private procurement throughout Indonesia, including Batam.</>,
