const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between a Surety Bond and a Bank Guarantee?",
    a: "A surety bond is issued by an insurance company and generally does not require collateral or a cash deposit like a bank guarantee. Premiums are lower and issuance is faster, making it ideal for contractors and companies that want to preserve liquidity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What surety bond values are available in Batam?",
    a: "Surety bond values vary according to project requirements, from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of rupiah. The premium is calculated based on contract value, bond type, and the applicant company's profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents are required for a surety bond application?",
    a: "Typically required: company deed of establishment, SIUP/NIB, financial statements for the last 2 years, tender/contract documents, and director data. For government projects, a tender invitation letter is usually also required.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a surety bond be used for both government and private projects?",
    a: "Yes. Surety bonds from OJK-licensed insurance companies are accepted for government procurement (Presidential Regulation 16/2018), SOEs, and private projects throughout Batam and Indonesia.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the surety bond issuance process take?",
    a: "The standard process takes 1–3 business days after complete documentation. For urgent needs, an express service is available with same-day or next-day issuance.",
  },
