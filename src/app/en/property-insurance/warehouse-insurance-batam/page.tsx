const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between warehouse insurance and marine cargo insurance?",
    a: "They are often considered the same but are fundamentally different. Warehouse insurance (Fire & Allied Perils or Industrial All Risk) protects goods while stored in the warehouse — static at a single location. Marine cargo insurance protects goods during the shipping process — by sea, air, or land. For businesses that both store and ship goods, having both is ideal to ensure no coverage gap exists between the storage point and the shipping point.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I determine the right sum insured for a warehouse?",
    a: "There are two components that need to be assessed separately. First, the building value — calculated based on the cost of rebuilding the warehouse to equivalent specifications (replacement cost), not market value or book value. Second, warehouse contents — either at invoice value (for consistent stock levels) or using a Declaration Policy (for fluctuating stock). Underinsurance on warehouses is dangerous because it can result in partial claims being paid proportionally, far below the actual loss.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a warehouse in Batam's industrial zones like Muka Kuning need special extensions?",
    a: "For industrial zones, several extensions worth considering include: flood extension (some locations in Muka Kuning and Kabil have experienced inundation during extreme rainfall), riot and civil commotion extension (standard for commercial property), and earthquake extension for high-value buildings. If the warehouse stores chemicals or hazardous materials, full disclosure to the underwriter is mandatory as this affects the premium rate and policy clauses.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can third-party goods stored in my warehouse be insured?",
    a: "Yes — this is known as goods in custody. You can take out a policy in your own name as bailee to protect your liability to the goods' owner. However, ideally the goods owner should also hold their own policy in their name. Coordination between the two policies is needed to avoid disputes at claim time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the typical premium range for warehouse insurance in Batam?",
    a: "Warehouse premiums have no standard published tariff as motor vehicle insurance does. Rates are determined by the underwriter based on the sum insured, building type (concrete, steel, semi-permanent), type of goods stored, fire protection systems in place, and claims history. As a general guide, Fire & Allied Perils rates for permanent-structure warehouses in Batam typically range from 0.05%–0.20% per year of the sum insured. Warehouses storing flammable or chemical materials may be subject to higher rates.",
