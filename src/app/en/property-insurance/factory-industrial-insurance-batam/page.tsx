const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Is a standard commercial property policy sufficient for a factory in Batam?",
    a: "No. Industrial property has a fundamentally different risk profile from standard commercial property. A factory policy needs to account for the value of production machinery, raw material stocks, processes involving hazardous materials, and potential environmental liability. A standard residential or shophouse policy is not designed for these requirements.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the machines inside the factory covered under the property policy?",
    a: "Machinery that forms a permanent part of the building is generally included under property all risk coverage. For more comprehensive protection against mechanical or electrical breakdown, a separate Machinery Breakdown Insurance (MBI) policy is recommended as a complement.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is fire risk managed in Batam's densely built industrial zones?",
    a: "This is highly relevant in Batam, particularly in zones like Batamindo or Muka Kuning where factory buildings stand in close proximity. Industrial all-risk policies typically cover fire spreading from neighbouring buildings. Ensure your sum insured reflects the full reinstatement cost, not the depreciated book value.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there insurance for losses from a production halt?",
    a: "Yes. This product is called Business Interruption (BI) or Loss of Profit Insurance. If your factory is forced to cease operations due to an insured loss, BI covers lost revenue and fixed ongoing costs during the repair and restoration period.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the sum insured determined for a factory?",
    a: "The sum insured should be based on the full reinstatement value of the building, plus the market value of production machinery, plus the average stock value. For large facilities, an independent appraisal is strongly recommended to avoid the financial exposure created by underinsurance.",
