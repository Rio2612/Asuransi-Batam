const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Is the building management's insurance policy sufficient for my unit?",
    a: "Insurance held by the building management or developer typically covers only the main building structure — not the contents of individual units, additional renovation works, or your personal liability as an owner. Personal unit insurance fills the gaps that the building policy does not cover.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a unit that is rented out also be insured?",
    a: "Yes. Both owner-occupied and tenanted units can be insured. For rented units, specific products are available that also cover loss of rental income resulting from an insured loss.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a condotel unit use this product?",
    a: "Yes. Condotel units operated as investment properties with daily or monthly rental management can be insured. The sum insured is based on the declared value of the unit and its contents.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does 'all risk' mean for apartment insurance?",
    a: "An all-risk apartment policy covers all causes of loss except those explicitly excluded in the policy wording (such as gradual wear, intentional damage). This differs from a named-perils policy, which only covers specific risks listed by name.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does apartment insurance typically cost in Batam?",
    a: "Premiums are calculated based on the unit and contents value, building location, and selected coverage. For a unit valued at IDR 500 million, annual premiums typically start from IDR 500,000 to IDR 2 million depending on the package chosen. Contact Rio for a specific quote.",
