const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Why is crane insurance so important in Batam?",
    a: "High-rise construction projects in Nongsa, Batam Center, and the Muka Kuning industrial estate continue to expand. Cranes operate at height with loads of tens of tonnes — the risk of accidents and damage to surrounding property is significant, including legal liability that can reach billions of rupiah.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents are required to apply for crane insurance?",
    a: "Typically required: a valid crane fitness certificate (SIO/SIA), a periodic maintenance logbook, data on K3-certified operators, technical specifications of the crane (capacity, year of manufacture, brand), and the crane's replacement value.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does crane insurance cost in Batam?",
    a: "Premiums depend on the crane's value, type (tower/mobile), lifting capacity, and location of operation. As a general guide, premiums range from 0.4%–1.2% of the sum insured per year. For example, a 50-tonne mobile crane worth Rp 3 billion would have a premium starting around Rp 12–36 million per year. Contact Rio for a specific quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a rented crane be insured by the tenant?",
    a: "Yes. The tenant/renter can take out a policy in their own name as the 'lessee' with the crane owner's consent. This matters because operational responsibility rests with the tenant for the duration of the rental.",
  },
  {
    q: "What sum insured is recommended for a crane?",
    a: "At minimum, the full replacement value of a new crane, to avoid underinsurance. For Third-Party Liability (TPL), the limit should be adequate for the project location's risk profile — at least Rp 1–5 billion for projects in Batam's congested industrial zones.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if a crane is involved in an accident?",
    a: "First, secure the site and document the damage with photos/video. Contact us immediately at +62-813-7333-6728 to report the claim within 3×24 hours. Do not move the crane before an insurer's survey is completed, unless there is a safety risk.",
