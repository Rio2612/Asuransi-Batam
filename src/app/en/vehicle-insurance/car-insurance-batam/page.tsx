const faqs = [
  { q: "How much is All Risk car insurance premium in Batam?", a: "Based on OJK regulations, All Risk premiums for Batam (Region 1) range from 1.05% to 3.46% of the insured value per year, depending on vehicle price and type. As an example, a car worth Rp 200 million may have a premium of approximately Rp 2.1 million – Rp 5 million per year. Use the premium calculator on this page for a more accurate estimate for your specific vehicle." },
  { q: "What is OJK's rating region and which region is Batam in?", a: "OJK divides Indonesia into 3 rating regions based on traffic risk levels and vehicle density. Batam is in Region 1 along with Sumatra and surrounding areas. Each region has different base rates — Region 1 generally has lower rates than Region 2 (Java, Madura, Bali), making Batam premiums relatively competitive." },
  { q: "Is a police report required to file a car insurance claim?", a: "Not always. For minor damage like scratches, small dents, or parking damage, most insurers do not require a police report. However, for major damage, collisions involving third parties, or vehicle theft, a police report must be included as a claim document. We will guide you step by step through the claims process." },
  { q: "How long does the car insurance claims process take?", a: "Generally, the claims process is quite swift: vehicle survey within 1–2 business days after the report is submitted, claim approval takes 3–7 business days depending on damage complexity, and workshop repairs are carried out according to the agreed timeframe. We assist in coordinating your claims process from start to finish." },
