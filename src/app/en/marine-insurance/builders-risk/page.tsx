const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is Builder's Risk Insurance for vessels?",
    a: "Builder's Risk Insurance (also known as Marine Builder's Risk or DSU – Delay in Start-Up) protects a vessel during construction at the shipyard. Coverage begins at keel laying and extends through sea trials and formal handover to the owner.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who needs Builder's Risk Insurance?",
    a: "Both the vessel owner commissioning the new build and the shipyard bearing construction risk need this coverage. Each party has an insurable interest that Builder's Risk is designed to protect.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Builder's Risk cover damage during sea trials?",
    a: "Yes. Most Builder's Risk policies include the sea trial period as part of the coverage period, since damage during trials is considered part of the construction process.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can major repair or drydocking work also be insured?",
    a: "Yes. In addition to new builds, Builder's Risk policies can cover major renovation, vessel conversion, or heavy refit work at a shipyard requiring extended drydocking.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Increased Value (IV) in Builder's Risk?",
    a: "Increased Value is supplementary coverage that compensates for the difference between the vessel's completed value and the primary sum insured — particularly relevant when the vessel's value grows significantly during construction.",
  },
