const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is Marine Cargo Insurance?",
    a: "Marine Cargo Insurance protects goods and commodities during transit from one location to another — whether by sea, air, or overland. Coverage applies against risks of physical damage, loss, and theft while goods are in transit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who should hold Marine Cargo Insurance?",
    a: "Any party involved in shipping high-value goods: exporters, importers, traders, distributors, manufacturers, and freight forwarders. This insurance protects the commercial value of goods while they are on the move.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between ICC A, B, and C clauses?",
    a: "ICC (A) provides the broadest cover — all risks except those explicitly excluded. ICC (B) covers named perils including fire, grounding, and flooding. ICC (C) covers the most limited set of major risks such as fire and vessel stranding. The right clause depends on the type of goods and risk appetite.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can domestic inter-island shipments within Indonesia be insured?",
    a: "Yes. Marine Cargo Insurance also covers domestic inter-island shipments, including routes such as Batam–Jakarta, Batam–Surabaya, and other domestic corridors.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a claim be made for goods damaged during loading or unloading?",
    a: "Yes, provided the goods are still within the policy period and the damage results from a covered risk. Policies typically cover goods on a warehouse-to-warehouse basis, which includes loading and unloading operations.",
  },
