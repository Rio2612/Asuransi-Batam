const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What is the difference between EAR and CAR Insurance?",
    a: "CAR (Contractor All Risk) is used for civil construction projects such as buildings and roads. EAR (Erection All Risk) is used for machinery installation, industrial plant, towers, and steel/iron structures.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of projects require EAR?",
    a: "EAR is ideal for: factory machinery installation, chemical plant construction, telecommunications tower erection, power plant (PLTU/PLTG) installation, large-scale HVAC system installation, and offshore projects.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does EAR cover initial testing (testing & commissioning)?",
    a: "Yes, EAR generally includes the testing & commissioning period with a specific clause. This is critically important because the highest risk typically occurs when machinery or plant is first tested.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much is an EAR Insurance premium?",
    a: "EAR premiums depend on contract value, erection complexity, testing risks, and project location. Typically ranging from 0.5%–2% of contract value. Contact us for a specific calculation.",
  },
