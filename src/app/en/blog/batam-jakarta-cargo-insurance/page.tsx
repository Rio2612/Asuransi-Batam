const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is cargo insurance mandatory for shipments from Batam to Jakarta?",
    a: "It is not legally required, but strongly advisable. The Batam–Jakarta route crosses the Karimata Strait and Java Sea, both known for rough conditions — especially during the west monsoon season (November–February). Without insurance, any loss or damage is borne entirely by the shipper.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does sea freight from Batam to Jakarta take?",
    a: "Typically 3–5 days for standard cargo vessels, depending on vessel type and weather conditions. Marine Cargo Insurance remains active throughout this transit period.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why can't I use land freight insurance for this route?",
    a: "Batam is an island — there is no road connection to Java. All shipments must travel by sea, which means Marine Cargo Insurance is the appropriate product to protect your goods in transit.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of goods can be insured on this route?",
    a: "Almost all commodity types: electronics and components, furniture, packaged food and beverages, building materials, industrial machinery, textiles, and consumer goods. High-value goods such as electronics and factory components are strongly recommended to use ICC (A) clause.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I file a claim if my goods arrive damaged in Jakarta?",
    a: "Document the damage with photos before breaking any seals or signing the delivery receipt. Immediately notify your insurance agent (contact Rio) and the shipping company. Prepare: Bill of Lading, commercial invoice, packing list, and damage photos. A licensed surveyor will then assess the claim.",

                Batam is an island — there is no overland route to Java. Every shipment bound for
                Jakarta must cross the Karimata Strait and the Java Sea, both of which experience
                significant wave action, particularly during the west monsoon season.

              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Batam's manufacturing industries — electronics, oil & gas components, shipbuilding
                parts, and automotive components — regularly ship goods worth billions of rupiah to
                Jakarta every week. The financial exposure without cargo insurance is substantial.
