      <h2>Batam: One of Indonesia&apos;s Leading Shipyard Hubs</h2>
      <p>
        Batam is far more than an electronics manufacturing and logistics centre — it is also one of Indonesia&apos;s most significant shipbuilding locations. Positioned at the intersection of the Malacca Strait and the Singapore Strait, dozens of shipyards operate in Batam — from small facilities repairing fishing vessels to internationally certified yards building offshore support vessels and crane barges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every vessel under construction, conversion, or major repair exists in its most <strong>physically vulnerable state</strong> — incomplete, with heavy human activity across its structure, and located in a facility that stores hazardous materials including welding gases, marine coatings, and fuel. This is precisely when a vessel needs dedicated protection: <strong>Builders Risk Insurance</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Marine Builders Risk Insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        Builders Risk Insurance protects a <strong>vessel during the construction or major repair process</strong> — from the moment the keel is laid or work commences, through to the vessel&apos;s completion and delivery to its owner.
      </p>
      <p>This is not standard hull insurance. An operational vessel is covered by Marine Hull Insurance. Builders Risk is specifically designed for the construction phase — when the vessel has no operational certificate and cannot sail independently.</p>

          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>How Is the Sum Insured Calculated?</h2>
      <p><strong>Agreed Value / Contract Price:</strong> The sum insured equals the full contract price from day one. Coverage is in full from the moment the policy commences. Most common method in Batam shipyards due to administrative simplicity.</p>
      <p><strong>Progressive Value:</strong> The sum insured increases in stages aligned to construction milestones. More actuarially precise but administratively complex.</p>

      <h2>What Determines the Premium?</h2>
      <div className="not-prose my-6 p-5 rounded-2xl border flex items-start gap-4" style={{ borderColor: "#c9a84c30", background: "#faf8f3" }}>
        <ShieldAlert size={22} className="flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5" style={{ color: "#a07830" }} />
        <p className="text-sm text-[#374151] m-0">
          Key rating factors: vessel type, contract value, construction duration, shipyard credentials and
          safety record, and coverage scope selected. As a general reference, Builders Risk premiums typically
          range from <strong style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>0.5% to 1.5% of the contract value</strong> per project —
          considerably higher than standard Marine Hull rates, reflecting the elevated risk profile of the
          construction phase.

          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>When Does the Builders Risk Policy End?</h2>
      <p>The policy terminates at whichever occurs first: the date of delivery of the vessel to the owner, successful completion of sea trials, or the expiry date in the policy schedule. Immediately upon delivery, the vessel owner must activate a Marine Hull policy to ensure the vessel is covered from the first moment it enters commercial service.</p>
