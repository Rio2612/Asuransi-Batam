However, it must be confirmed there is no double insurance — if the equipment owner already has an active policy covering the same period, complications can arise at claims time. Coordinate with the owner before taking out an additional policy." },
  { q: "What if the excavator is damaged due to operator error?", a: "EAR policies generally cover damage caused by operator negligence as long as it is not intentional (willful misconduct). Damage caused by an unqualified or uncertified operator can be grounds for rejection in some policies — make sure all operators hold a valid SIO (Operator Licence)." },
  { q: "Is the policy still valid when the equipment is on standby?", a: "Yes. As long as the policy is active and premiums are paid, coverage remains in place even when the unit is parked or on standby — including fire, theft, or natural disaster risks while not in use." },

      <p>
        On project sites across Batam — from industrial zone developments to port reclamation
        works — excavators and bulldozers operate under far from ideal conditions. Hard ground,
        waterlogged terrain, steep slopes, and relentless operational pressure make both machines
        among the most damage-prone assets on any site. A mid-range excavator unit alone
        is worth between Rp 800 million and Rp 2 billion. If it suffers serious damage without
        insurance protection, the contractor can face losses equivalent to the profit margin
        of several projects combined.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article specifically covers how insurance protection for excavators and bulldozers
        works, what is and isn't covered, and how to navigate the claims process in Batam.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Do Excavators and Bulldozers Need Their Own Insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        Some contractors still assume that project insurance (CAR/EAR) is sufficient to
        cover all assets on site. In practice, it's not that straightforward. A CAR
        (Contractor's All Risk) policy can include heavy equipment, but its coverage is
        limited to risks arising <em>within a specific project scope</em> and during the
        active contract period. Once the equipment moves to another project or the contract
        ends, the protection lapses immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast, an <strong>Equipment All Risk (EAR)</strong> policy is designed to
        protect the unit itself — not the project. The policy follows the unit wherever
        it operates, for as long as the policy remains active. This makes EAR far more
        relevant for equipment owners whose units move between project sites throughout
        the year.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-World Risks for Excavators and Bulldozers in the Field</h2>
      <p>
        Before choosing a policy, it's important to understand the types of risks that
        most commonly affect both machines based on actual field conditions:

      <h2>How to Determine the Right Sum Insured</h2>
      <p>
        This is the question that comes up most often when equipment owners arrange
        insurance for the first time. There are two common approaches:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-5 my-6">
        <div className="rounded-2xl p-6 border-2" style={{ borderColor: "#0a162820", background: "#0a16280a" }}>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
            <Scale size={18} style={{ color: "#0a1628" }} />
            <p className="font-bold text-sm" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>Market Value</p>
          </div>
          <p className="text-sm text-[#475569]">
            The current resale value of the unit in the secondhand market, taking into account
            age and machine hours. More commonly used for units over three years old — payout
            reflects market value at the time of the incident.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="rounded-2xl p-6 border-2" style={{ borderColor: "#c9a84c30", background: "#faf8f3" }}>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
            <Scale size={18} style={{ color: "#a07830" }} />
            <p className="font-bold text-sm" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>Replacement Value</p>
          </div>
          <p className="text-sm text-[#475569]">
            The cost of a new unit with equivalent specifications at current market prices.
            Premiums are higher, but payout is more favourable since no depreciation is deducted.
            Best for new units or units under financing.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Insurance companies typically require a physical survey of the unit before issuing
        a policy. The surveyor will inspect the physical condition, check the hour meter
        reading, and verify ownership documents. Make sure the unit is in well-maintained
        condition at the time of the survey.
