      <p>
        Batam is a city built on the wheels of trade and industry. From rows of shophouses
        in Nagoya and Jodoh, logistics warehouses in Muka Kuning and Kabil, to office
        buildings and hotels in Batam Center — commercial properties in this city hold
        enormous asset value. Yet unlike residential homes, whose protection is relatively
        straightforward, commercial property insurance has layers of complexity that
        owners often don't realise exist until they actually need to make a claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article provides a comprehensive overview of how commercial property owners
        in Batam can make the right decisions when selecting and structuring their
        property insurance policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Does Commercial Property Need a Different Policy from a Residence?</h2>
      <p>
        This is the most common misconception. Many shophouse and warehouse owners insure
        their commercial properties using a standard home insurance policy because it's
        cheaper and easier to arrange. When a claim arises, they discover that home
        insurance policies contain explicit exclusions for property used for commercial
        purposes. There are three fundamental differences from an insurance perspective:
