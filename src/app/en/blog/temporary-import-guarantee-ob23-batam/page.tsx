const faqs = [
  { q: "What is OB 23 and why is it called that?", a: "OB 23 stands for Ordonansi Bea Article 23, the older legal basis governing temporary import facilities in Indonesia. The term is still widely used in practice, even though the current legal basis refers to the Customs Law and Ministry of Finance Regulation 259/PMK.04/2010. In essence, OB 23 is a permit to bring goods into Indonesia temporarily with import duty exemption, on condition the goods are re-exported within a set period." },
  { q: "What is the maximum duration for OB 23?", a: "The temporary import period generally follows the actual needs of the activity (e.g., the duration of an exhibition or project) and can be extended with Customs' approval. In practice it ranges from a few weeks up to a maximum of 3 years for certain cases such as project heavy equipment. The key is always filing the extension before the current period expires." },
  { q: "Is OB 23 the same as KITE?", a: "No. OB 23 is for goods that are not processed and must be re-exported in the same form (e.g., exhibition equipment or heavy equipment). KITE is for raw materials imported to be processed into finished goods, with the processed output being what's exported — the form of the goods changes." },
  { q: "What happens if OB 23 goods are damaged and cannot be re-exported?", a: "Customs will collect the import duty and VAT that had been exempted, based on the goods' condition at that time. The custom bond will be claimed for that amount if the company does not pay directly. It's best to report the condition to Customs as soon as possible to get proper guidance on resolution." },
  { q: "Can a foreign company without a legal entity in Indonesia apply for OB 23 directly?", a: "Generally it must go through a local party — a subsidiary, local partner, or customs broker (PPJK) — acting as the Principal responsible for the customs obligations in Indonesia, including issuing the custom bond." },

            A South Korean oil & gas contractor won an 8-month offshore platform maintenance
            project in Batam waters. They needed to bring in specialized equipment worth{" "}
            <strong>IDR 3.5 billion</strong> that would be shipped back to Korea once the project
            was complete. Since the equipment would not stay permanently in Indonesia, their legal
            team applied for the <strong>OB 23 (Temporary Import)</strong> facility and issued a
            custom bond as a guarantee to Customs — instead of paying the full import duty upfront,
            which could have run into hundreds of millions of rupiah.
