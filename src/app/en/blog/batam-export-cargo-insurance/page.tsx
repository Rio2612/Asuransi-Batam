const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Are Batam exporters required to hold cargo insurance?",
    a: "It depends on the agreed Incoterms in your export contract. Under CIF or CIP terms, the exporter is obligated to provide cargo insurance. Under FOB or EXW terms, insurance responsibility shifts to the buyer. Regardless of Incoterms, having your own policy is strongly recommended to protect your business interests.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between export and import cargo policies?",
    a: "The underlying clauses and products are the same. The distinction lies in who takes out the policy: exporters for outbound shipments, importers for inbound ones. From Batam, exporters typically insure the route from their warehouse to the final destination port in the receiving country.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can export cargo insurance from Batam cover shipments to any country?",
    a: "Yes. Marine Cargo Insurance is inherently international — it can cover routes to any approved destination country. Popular routes from Batam include Singapore, Malaysia (Port Klang), China, Japan, and European countries.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if an overseas buyer rejects goods due to damage?",
    a: "If the damage occurred during transit and falls under a covered risk, the exporter can file a claim with the insurer. An independent surveyor will be dispatched to assess the damage, and the claim will be settled based on the sum insured declared in the policy.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can goods exhibited at an overseas trade fair also be insured?",
    a: "Yes. A specialist exhibition endorsement or policy extension can cover goods from the moment they leave Batam, throughout the trade fair period, and until they are returned to Indonesia. Speak to your agent about this specific coverage need.",
