      <p>
        Mining operations — whether nickel, bauxite, silica sand, or coal — rely on fleets
        of heavy equipment working under extreme conditions: silica dust, thick mud, sharp
        slopes, and 10–20 hour operational cycles every day. A single mining dump truck
        unit can be worth Rp 3–5 billion. A mining-class excavator can reach Rp 5–8 billion.
        When equipment like this suffers serious damage or total loss without insurance
        coverage, the loss is not just the unit's value — it's also the daily production
        stoppage, which can amount to tens of millions of rupiah per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't simply a matter of being financially prudent. In the Indonesian mining
        context, there is a regulatory dimension that makes heavy equipment insurance not
        just optional, but effectively mandatory.
      </p>

      <h2>Regulations That Require Asset Protection in Mining Areas</h2>
      <p>
        Under <strong>Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 1827 K/30/MEM/2018</strong>
        on Good Mining Technical Practice Guidelines, mining companies are required to
        implement risk management that includes protection of operational assets. In practice,
        financial institutions that finance heavy equipment purchases for mines (leasing or
        instalment financing) almost invariably require an active insurance policy as a
        disbursement condition and throughout the repayment period.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that if your equipment is still under a financing arrangement — which
        is the situation for the majority of mid-scale mining contractors — insurance has
        effectively already become a contractual obligation, not a choice.
      </p>

      <h2>Mining Risk vs General Construction: The Key Differences</h2>
      <p>
        Many equipment owners insure their mining units with the same standard policy
        they use for building construction projects. This is a potentially costly mistake.
        Insurance underwriters distinguish between these two contexts because the risk
        profiles are genuinely and significantly different:

        <table className="w-full text-sm">
          <thead className="bg-[#0a1628] text-white">
            <tr>
              <th className="text-left p-4">Risk Factor</th>

              ["Distance from repair facilities", "Close (in town)", "Far (remote area)"],
              ["Unit value in operation", "Rp 500M – 2B", "Rp 2B – 8B+"],
            ].map(([a, b, c], i) => (

            ))}
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        These risk profile differences are reflected in higher premiums and specific clauses
        that must be present in any policy for mining operations. If you use a standard
        policy without a mining clause, claims that arise on a mining site may be rejected
        on the grounds that the situation falls outside the agreed scope.

      <h2>How Mining Equipment Insurance Premiums Are Calculated</h2>
      <p>
        There is no published standard tariff for heavy equipment insurance as there is
        for motor vehicle insurance (which is regulated by OJK). Premiums are calculated
        on a <em>case-by-case</em> basis by the underwriter based on a number of factors:
      </p>

            <span className="text-sm text-[#374151]">{text}</span>

        <p className="text-sm text-[#374151] m-0">
          As a general guide, EAR premiums for mining heavy equipment typically range from{" "}
          <strong style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>1.5% to 3.5%</strong> of the sum insured per year,
          depending on the factors above. To get an accurate figure for your specific fleet,
          a direct consultation with an experienced insurance agent in this sector is the
          most reliable approach.
