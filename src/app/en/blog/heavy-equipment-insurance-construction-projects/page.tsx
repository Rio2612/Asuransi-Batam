  { q: "What if heavy equipment is stolen from a project site?", a: "Theft is generally covered under EAR, but a police report must be filed promptly. There is typically a waiting period (60–90 days) before payout, allowing time for law enforcement to search." },
  { q: "Does the equipment operator need a valid SIO for claims to be processed?", a: "Yes, in most policies. An SIO (Operator Licence) proves the operator is competent and licensed. Without a valid SIO at the time of incident, the insurer can reject the claim on safety-negligence grounds." },

      <p>
        In the construction world, heavy equipment is more than just machinery — it is the
        backbone of project productivity. Without an excavator, earthworks stall. Without
        a bulldozer, land clearing cannot begin. Without a wheel loader, the material
        cycle stops. One unit breaking down mid-project is not just a repair cost problem —
        it means delay penalties, contractor reputation damage, and a loss of trust with
        the project owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet many contractors still insure their heavy equipment in a haphazard way: taking
        out the cheapest policy without understanding what is actually covered, or not
        insuring at all on the assumption that "nothing serious has happened so far."
        This article is designed to turn that approach into something more strategic.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding Heavy Equipment Insurance: EAR vs CAR — What's the Difference?</h2>
      <p>
        This is the most common source of confusion among newer contractors. These two
        terms are often used interchangeably, but they protect fundamentally different things.

            project owners in tender documents or contracts.

      <p>
        In practice, many contractors use <strong>both simultaneously</strong>: CAR to
        meet contractual requirements, and EAR as permanent protection for their fleet
        beyond the scope of any individual project. Coordinating the two policies carefully
        is essential to avoid coverage gaps or unnecessary overlap.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Equipment Should Be Insured?</h2>
      <p>
        The short answer: any unit with a significant value whose breakdown would materially
        disrupt project operations. Here is a practical guide by equipment category:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
        {EQUIPMENT.map(({ icon: Icon, title, desc }) => (
          <div key={title} className="rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white border border-[#e2e8f0] shadow-sm">
            <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center mb-3" style={{ background: "#0a162810" }}>
              <Icon size={20} style={{ color: "#0a1628" }} />
            </div>
            <p className="font-bold text-sm mb-1.5" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{title}</p>
            <p className="text-sm text-[#475569]">{desc}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>How to Determine the Right Sum Insured</h2>
      <p>Setting the correct sum insured is the single most critical step in the policy process. The two most common mistakes are:</p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
        {SUM_INSURED_MISTAKES.map(({ icon: Icon, title, desc, color }) => (
          <div key={title} className="rounded-2xl p-5 border" style={{ borderColor: color + "30", background: color + "0a" }}>
            <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
              <Icon size={18} style={{ color }} />
              <p className="font-bold text-sm" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{title}</p>
            </div>
            <p className="text-sm text-[#475569]">{desc}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <p>Recommended approach for determining the sum insured:</p>
      <div className="not-prose space-y-3 my-6">
        {SUM_INSURED_STEPS.map((step, i) => (
          <div key={step.title} className="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-[#faf8f3] border border-[#e2e8f0]">
            <div className="w-8 h-8 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-xs flex-shrink-0" style={{ background: "#0a1628" }}>
              {i + 1}
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-semibold text-sm" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{step.title}</p>
              <p className="text-sm text-[#475569] mt-0.5">{step.desc}</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>Documents Needed When Taking Out a Policy</h2>
      <p>Preparing these upfront will speed up underwriting and avoid requests for additional documents that delay policy issuance:</p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-6">
        {DOCUMENTS.map(({ icon: Icon, text }) => (
          <div key={text} className="flex items-center gap-3 p-3.5 rounded-xl bg-white border border-[#e2e8f0]">
            <Icon size={18} className="flex-shrink-0" style={{ color: "#1a4fa0" }} />
            <span className="text-sm text-[#374151]">{text}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>What to Do When Equipment Breaks Down on Site</h2>
      <p>Many claims end up rejected not because the damage isn't covered, but because the reporting procedure wasn't followed correctly. Here is the right sequence:</p>
      <div className="not-prose space-y-4 my-6">
        {BREAKDOWN_STEPS.map(({ icon: Icon, title, desc }, i) => (
          <div key={title} className="flex items-start gap-4 p-5 rounded-2xl bg-white border border-[#e2e8f0] shadow-sm">
            <div className="w-11 h-11 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0" style={{ background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #0a1628, #1a4fa0)" }}>
              <Icon size={20} className="text-white" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-semibold text-sm mb-1 flex items-center gap-2" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>
                <span className="text-xs font-bold px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full" style={{ background: "#c9a84c20", color: "#a07830" }}>Step {i + 1}</span>
                {title}
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-[#475569]">{desc}</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
