      <p>
        Nobody wants to experience a house fire. But it's precisely in those moments that
        we truly find out whether the insurance we've been paying premiums on actually works.
        Many homeowners in Batam end up disappointed not because their insurer acted in bad
        faith, but because the claims procedure wasn't followed correctly from the very
        first minute after the incident. This guide covers in detail what you must do —
        and what you must not do — to ensure your home fire insurance claim is processed
        and paid without unnecessary obstacles.
      </p>

      <h2>First, Understand: What Does Home Fire Insurance Actually Cover?</h2>
      <p>
        Before discussing the procedure, it's important to understand that not all
        fire-related damage is automatically covered by insurance. Standard property
        policies in Indonesia use the <strong>FLEXAS</strong> format as the base:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-5 gap-3 my-6">
        {FLEXAS.map(({ letter, label, icon: Icon }) => (
          <div key={letter} className="rounded-2xl p-4 text-center border" style={{ borderColor: "#0a162820", background: "#0a16280a" }}>
            <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-2 text-white font-bold" style={{ background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #0a1628, #1a4fa0)" }}>
              {letter}
            </div>
            <Icon size={16} className="mx-auto mb-1" style={{ color: "#a07830" }} />
            <p className="text-xs font-semibold" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{label}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <p>
        Extensions such as flood, storm, riot, and earthquake are only covered if they
        are explicitly stated in your policy. Before submitting a claim, open your policy
        and check the coverage summary — make sure the cause of the fire or damage you
        experienced is actually included in what was agreed.
      </p>

      <h2>What You Must Do in the First 24 Hours</h2>
      <p>
        The hours immediately following a fire are the most critical for a successful claim.
        Panic is completely understandable, but certain actions taken (or not taken) during
        this phase can determine whether your claim succeeds or fails.
      </p>

      <h2>Documents Required for the Claim Submission</h2>
      <p>
        The formal claims process cannot begin until all of these documents have been
        submitted to the insurer. Prepare them from the outset to avoid back-and-forth
        that slows down the payout:
      </p>

      <h2>How Long Does a Home Fire Insurance Claim Take to Settle?</h2>

      <div className="not-prose space-y-3 my-6">
        {TIMELINE.map((t) => (
          <div key={t.range} className="flex items-center gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-[#faf8f3] border border-[#e2e8f0]">
            <Timer size={20} className="flex-shrink-0" style={{ color: "#c9a84c" }} />
            <div className="flex-1">
              <p className="text-sm font-semibold" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{t.range}</p>
              <p className="text-xs text-[#64748b]">{t.note}</p>
            </div>
            <span className="text-sm font-bold px-3 py-1.5 rounded-full text-white flex-shrink-0" style={{ background: "#0a1628" }}>{t.duration}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <p>
        Complete documentation from the outset is the single most significant factor in
        speeding up the process. Every request for an additional document from the insurer
        can add 5–10 working days to the total processing time.
