const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Can marine cargo insurance cover machinery and heavy equipment?",
    a: "Yes. Marine Cargo Insurance can cover the transit of industrial machinery and heavy equipment — whether shipped by sea, overland, or a combination of both. This is distinct from Machinery Insurance, which covers operational risks while the equipment is in use at a work site.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the biggest risks when shipping machinery by sea?",
    a: "The main risks include: physical damage from shock and vessel movement during loading/unloading, rust and corrosion from exposure to salt-laden sea air, deformation from improper cargo stacking, and damage to electronic or hydraulic components from moisture and vibration. Oversized machinery shipped as breakbulk cargo is generally more exposed than containerised goods.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a difference between insuring new vs second-hand machinery?",
    a: "Yes. New machinery is generally easier and less expensive to insure as its condition and value are clearly established. Second-hand equipment typically requires a pre-shipment condition survey, and premiums may be higher. Some insurers also restrict coverage for machinery beyond a certain age.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a pre-shipment survey required for high-value machinery?",
    a: "For machinery above a certain declared value threshold (commonly above IDR 500 million, or as specified by the insurer), a condition survey prior to loading is typically required. This survey confirms the equipment is fit for transit and supports the claims process if damage occurs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can machinery shipped in a knocked-down (KD) condition be insured?",
    a: "Yes. Machinery shipped in knocked-down or partially assembled form can be fully insured. Ensure all components are listed in the packing list and that the policy covers loading and unloading risks at the port.",
  },

            Industrial machinery and heavy equipment are high-value assets that face unique risks
            during sea transit — from saltwater corrosion and wave shock to port handling damage.
