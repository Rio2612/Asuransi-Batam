      <p>
        Batam's status as a Free Trade Zone (FTZ) makes it home to thousands of industrial
        companies — from shipyards and electronics manufacturers to chemical processing plants.
        Almost all of these industries generate waste classified as Hazardous and Toxic Materials
        (Limbah B3 — Bahan Berbahaya dan Beracun). For many of them, holding the right insurance
        is not a matter of choice. It is a legal requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Hazardous Waste (B3)?</h2>
      <p>
        Hazardous waste (B3) refers to any residual material from industrial or business
        activities that contains substances which are dangerous or toxic and which — due to
        their nature, concentration, or volume — have the potential to contaminate the
        environment or harm human health. Common examples generated by industries in Batam include:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-3 my-6">
        {WASTE_TYPES.map(({ icon: Icon, label }) => (
          <div key={label} className="rounded-2xl p-4 bg-white border border-[#e2e8f0] shadow-sm text-center">
            <Icon size={20} className="mx-auto mb-2" style={{ color: "#a07830" }} />
            <p className="text-xs font-semibold" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{label}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>The Legal Obligation: Government Regulation No. 22 of 2021</h2>
      <p>
        Under <strong>Government Regulation (PP) No. 22 of 2021</strong> on the Implementation
        of Environmental Protection and Management, every business operator that produces or
        manages B3 waste is <strong>legally required to hold a financial guarantee</strong>.
        This may take one of three forms:
      </p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-6">
        {GUARANTEE_OPTIONS.map(({ icon: Icon, title, desc }) => (
          <div key={title} className="rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white border border-[#e2e8f0] shadow-sm">
            <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-xl flex items-center justify-center mb-3" style={{ background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #0a1628, #1a4fa0)" }}>
              <Icon size={18} className="text-white" />
            </div>
            <p className="font-bold text-sm mb-1.5" style={{ color: "#0a1628" }}>{title}</p>
            <p className="text-sm text-[#64748b]">{desc}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <p>
        Of these options, insurance is by far the most practical and cost-effective. It
        eliminates the need to lock up large amounts of cash in a dedicated account while
        providing broader protection should an actual contamination incident occur.
      </p>

      <h2>Consequences of Non-Compliance</h2>
      <p>Industries that fail to meet their financial guarantee obligations under PP 22/2021 face the following penalties:</p>
      <div className="not-prose grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
        {CONSEQUENCES.map(({ icon: Icon, title, desc }) => (

            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2>Why Batam Carries Higher Environmental Risk</h2>
      <p>As an island surrounded entirely by sea, Batam has a particularly sensitive ecosystem that amplifies the consequences of any contamination incident:</p>
